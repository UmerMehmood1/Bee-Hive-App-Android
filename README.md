# Beehive Monitoring App

Welcome to the Beehive Monitoring App, an Android application designed to help beekeepers monitor the health and activity of their beehives. The app connects to sensors placed in the hives, collecting data on temperature, humidity, sound levels, and more. This data is then displayed in an intuitive dashboard, providing real-time insights and alerts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: View live data from your beehives, including temperature, humidity, sound levels, and other important metrics.
- **Hive Details**: Get detailed information on each hive, including historical data and trends.
- **Alerts**: Receive notifications when sensor values exceed predefined thresholds, helping you respond quickly to potential issues.
- **Statistics**: View daily, weekly, and monthly statistics to analyze the health and productivity of your hives over time.
- **Settings**: Customize the app settings, including alert thresholds, notification preferences, and user profile.
